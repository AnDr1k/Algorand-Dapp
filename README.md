This project demonstrates how to build a dApp with Algorand and the JavaScript Algorand SDK. It is a simple counter dApp that allows users to set, increment, decrement and query the value of a counter. The high level technical details are:

The environment: Algorand sandbox (a sandbox is a simulated network of nodes that can be used for testing and development purposes).
Smart contract: written in Python.
Frontend: written in React Hooks + JS AlgoSDK.
